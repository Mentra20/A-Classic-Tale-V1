# A-Classic-Tale-V1
My first version of **A Classic Tale** (my first program too) from the ISN high school course  
_(don't look too closely at the code, it's terrible. Fortunately I formatted it afterwards, otherwise it was even worse.)_   

Work with https://processing.org/download

Submission files are in French in folder "_Rendu_"  
It is accompanied by a very simple site in the "_Site_" folder

Use **arrow key** to move, **A** for action and **Shift** for laying down on the ground. Use your **mouse** in the dialog windows.
